## About the project:

_DictonaryXML - It's a simple dictionary supporting Spanish, English, Russian._

## Why the application was created:

_This project was created to study XML. I decided to arrange a challenge for myself and did not use the database, but instead, the storage of words will be in format xml_

---

## How to start:

#### 1 Run the application
#### 2 Close the application
#### 3 Go to DictonaryXML.UI / bin / debug /
#### 4 In the Words.xml file, paste this text:

``` XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Words>
  <WordsList>
    <Word>
      <MainWord>MainWord</MainWord>
      <TranslationWord>TranslationWord</TranslationWord>
      <PartOfSpeech>0</PartOfSpeech>
      <Gender>0</Gender>
      <Description>Description</Description>
